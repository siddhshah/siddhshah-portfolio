    title: Accelerating Object Detection With Hardware
    text: >
      The goal of this project was to put a unique spin on standard ultrasonic
      sensor-based detection and examine the benefits of using an FPGA over a
      standard C/C++-based microcontroller e.g. Arduino, all while testing the
      hardware limitations of an FPGA for real-time data processing.
